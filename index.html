    <h1 id="important1">The Best Dogs Ever</h1>
    <div class="media"><p>The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel wears his connection to British history in his breed's name. Cavaliers are the best of two worlds, combining the gentle attentiveness of a toy breed with the verve and athleticism of a sporting spaniel. The Cavalier's all-around beauty, regal grace, and even temper mark him as one of dogdom's noblemen. </p></div>

<h2>My name is Conner Anglin, and I have three of the best dogs you could wish for. Their names are Bently, Baily, and Lilly and I will be showing them to you.</h2>

<h2>This is Bently</h2>
    <p>Bently is the newest addition to the clan of <b> Anglin. </b> I got Bently after moving away from home and living in Denver. He is a <em>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</em>, whith more personality than most people. He loves going for rides in the car and going outside.</p>

<p id="important2">If you cant already tell by the look in Bently's eyes he is rather <strong>Mischievous.</strong>some of his favorite activities are digging holes in the search of creatures,
    bringing new found sticks inside while leaving his toys outside, and thinking he is as big as our other dogs. But with how cute he is, it becomes very hard to blame him for differnt things like sitting in the kitchen awaiting my mom for dropped food.</p>

<p>Even with the mischievous look that Bently gives off, deep down he is a sweetheart. Anytime that he is left at home with out human interaction he likes to steal my moms, my dads, and my shoes and proceeds to sleep with them. He dose not chew on them or ruin them in anyway, he just likes to sleep with them.
    At night time if you came into the house after he was asleep, he wakes up and rushes to the door. He then likes to pick up whatever toy he can find and show it to you, wigling as hard as he can so happy that you finally came home. </p>

<h3>Here are some dog houses that I belive Bently would like to have.</h3>
